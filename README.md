# SecretSanta
A secret santa program that matches given names and sends each person an email on who they are a secret santa for.

This program was created in python and utilizes a secure SMTP connection in order to sign in to a user email and send each player an email on which other player they got. I created this program for my friends and I to use since we all decided we wanted to do secret santa this year, but we wanted everyone to participate and for there to not be a chance of getting eachother. Typically someone would have to abstain and match people in order to make sure we didn't get eachother, so to avoid this I created this program.

There is user input handling to make sure of a few basic requirements, but the program doesn't have error handling for putting incorrect user and sender emails in or a correct password, so make sure to check twice.
